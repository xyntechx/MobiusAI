# MobiusAI
> For a dynamic AI ecosystem

[MobiusAI](https://themobius.ai/) enables researchers to launch campaigns for backers (companies and independent developers) to pledge money towards in order to fund the development of open-source models. This promotes the continuous improvement of open-source models, preventing a stagnant AI ecosystem polluted by outdated pre-trained models.
